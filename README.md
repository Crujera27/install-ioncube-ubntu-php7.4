# Ioncube installer for Ubuntu (php7.4 on nginx)
I grew weary of the repetitive task of manually installing the Roundcube loader on each machine during the configuration process. Consequently, I have developed a solution to streamline this process. By default, this script automates the installation of the PHP 7.4 loader for NGINX, with a specific focus on the Ubuntu operating system.

` bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Crujera27/install-ioncube-ubntu-php7.4/main/install-ioncube.sh)c `
